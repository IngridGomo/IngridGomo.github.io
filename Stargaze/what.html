                <h4>NEBULAS</h4>
                <p>
                    A nebula is a cloud of dust and gas, usually tens to
                    hundreds of light years across. A galaxy is much larger
                    â€” usually thousands to hundreds of thousands of light years
                    across. Nebulae are one of the many things that galaxies are 
                    made of, along with stars, black holes, cosmic dust, 
                    dark matter and much more.

                <h4>CONSTELLATIONS</h4>
                <p>
                    There are a few different definitions of constellations, 
                    but many people think of constellations as a group of stars. 
                    Often, it's a group of stars that looks like a particular shape 
                    in the sky and has been given a name. These stars are far away 
                    from Earth. They are not connected to each other at all.

                <h4>SHOOTING STARS</h4>
                <p>
                    A "falling star" or a "shooting star" has nothing at all to 
                    do with a star! These amazing streaks of light you can 
                    sometimes see in the night sky are caused by tiny bits of 
                    dust and rock called meteoroids falling into the Earth's 
                    atmosphere and burning up.

                <h4>SATELITTES</h4>
                <p>
                    You can see satellites in particular orbits as they 
                    pass overhead at night. Viewing is best away from city 
                    lights and in cloud-free skies. The satellite will 
                    look like a star steadily moving across the sky for a few minutes.

                <h4>AURORA BOREALIS</h4>
                <p>
                    The best way to see the northern lights is to head 
                    north. Most of the molecular activity that causes 
                    the northern lights happens near the Earth's magnetic 
                    poles. For that reason, the Arctic region is an ideal 
                    location for hunting the aurora.
